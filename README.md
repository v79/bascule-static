# Bascule
Static site generator inspired by jekyll and griffin

Having abandoned my CMS project for now, I thought I'd try a static site generator instead _a la_ *jekyll, griffin* etc. Blog posts and pages are written in Markdown, and the generated content is rendered via Handlebars scripts. A simple `bascule generate` command parses all source files in a folder and spits out HTML files ready to be deployed to a web server.
