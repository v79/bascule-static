_Deep Simplicity_ really drew me in. Chaos and complexity is something I thought I knew a bit about, in layman's terms at least - I do read _Scientific American_. But John Gribbon really took the time to explain where the modern science of Chaos and Complexity came from, and what it actually means.

There are many more implications than I had thought of - from the orbits of planets to grains of sand, from earthquakes to the building blocks of life. This is all presented in a very readable style, light on the scientific jargon which could so easily overwhelm a lesser book. Gribbon isn't ashamed to plug his other books, but is fair and gives plenty of references to follow up. This isn't a scientist's book - but it is an enjoyable and rewarding read for the rest of us.
