I've been doing a lot of tinkering with Cinnabar, recently, but I haven't been making substantial progress. I've added a rich text editor component, courtesy of [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/). I've redesigned the main overview page, making its appearance much more consistent with the rest of the application. I've found a neat, free way of hosting the application online for testing purposes, through a platform called _Cloudbees_. I've been exploring unit testing with the [Spock Framework](https://code.google.com/p/spock/). I can even generate a web page, or at least some HTML, from text content and HTML layouts.

Sadly, a lot of this work has been a delaying tactic for me, as I'm skirting around the key component of any web site - links. Cinnabar has no mechanism to link pages together, and that's something I really need to tackle. It won't be easy, and I really need to sit down with a pad of paper and think it through before I start cutting code. It will definitely need a new data model (more database changes!). My day job has been very busy recently, and is going to get even busier as we ready for the first release of the new _Rural Scotland_ platform from the Scottish Government. So I haven't given myself the time to do the deep thinking that _Cinnabar_ needs to progress. I think once release 1 of _Rural Scotland_ is out I'll treat myself to a little holiday and time to think and plan.
