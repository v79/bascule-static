I've just finished reading [Greg Egan's Zendegi](http://www.gregegan.net/ "Greg Egan's Zendegi"), a near-future novel set in Iran exploring the possibilities of modelling human thought in computers. It was an easy, enjoyable read - much easier to read than some of Egan's harder SF such as _Schild's Ladder_, and it feels almost like a companion piece to his earlier novel _Permutation City_. That novel proposed a world where human consciousness could be uploaded and ran on computers, and then ran with the idea to explore the possibilities and limitations of an entirely virtual existence. _Zendegi_ could be read as a precursor to this, where software engineer and biologist Nasim uses MRI and other scans to try to simulate thought, though not consciousness. Egan's world is entirely believable, his technology feels _just around the corner_, his virtual gaming environment, the titular _Zendegi_, feels almost inevitable.

I enjoyed the read. I enjoyed the setting (an democratised, almost liberal Iran), peppered with stories from Iranian folklore. There are hints of the short-lived TV series _Caprica_, which I loved.

And yet. And yet... like _Caprica_, like the TV pilot _Virtuality_, even like the Richard Gere film _Arbitrage_, the book failed at the last hurdle for me. After asking so many interesting questions, laying out possibilities, _Zendegi_ just fizzled out. I'm getting the feeling that denouements are no longer required or expected. Or maybe it's just the sort of fiction and TV I enjoy is too much about questions that can't really be answered.

I recommend _Zendegi_, it's a lot simpler to read than some of Egan's other works, it's well paced. It just needed a stronger ending.
