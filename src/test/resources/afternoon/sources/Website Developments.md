My home-grown CMS project, **Cinnabar**, has completely stalled. There are two main reasons for this - my day job is taking up all my days, and playing Factorio is taking up all my nights. At work we have completed a "soft" launch of the new Rural Payments Scotland website to internal users, and as I type the public launch is being readied.

Yet I have still found the time to build a new website. My Dad called and tasked me with building a multi-author blog site for a client of his, and gave me less than a week to get it running. With so little time, I had to go with WordPress and bought a theme which roughly matched the client's requirements. The website, _VetSwap_, is a collaborative blog between two vets and their families, who have swapped homes and practices for three months. One vet is from Dunfermline, Scotland and the other from Lilongwe, Malawi. It's quite a remarkable change for both vets, and pity the poor family who are spending three months in wintery Scotland instead of hot, dry Malawi.

I think I should learn WordPress theme development, as it seems to be a pretty marketable skill. I'm not a fan of PHP, however, and I am no CSS expert. In building Vetswap, I had to modify a pink-and-blue theme designed for a wedding blog, stripping it of the pastels and lovehearts and creating something a little more appropriate to professional vets. I stuck roughly to the colour schemes of one vet's own websites, [Inglis Vets Dunfermline](http://www.inglisvets.com "Inglis Vets Dunfermline"), and picked out highlights using colours from the Scottish and Malawian flags.

The blog has done remarkably well in just a couple of weeks, so it looks like I will need to continually update it during the length of the Vet Swap project.
