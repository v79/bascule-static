When I was very young my bedroom was painted in four different colours - bright primary colours my parents thought were modern and youthful. Unfortunately I don't remember those colours - my earliest bedroom memories were of blue walls and a blue carpet, blue curtains, and lots of glow-in-the-dark star stickers on the wardrobe and ceiling. I lived in that house for twelve years - twelve oddly-coloured years. The living room doors were painted a blue gloss (that took a lot of shifting); the hallway was green; the box room that I adopted as my personal TV/computer room as soon as I was able was painted brown with red gloss. There was a lot of red gloss.

It sounds much more horrendous when written like that than I remember it being. What's wrong with an olive-green hallway? As I got older, those colours mellowed, and when I moved aged twelve, our new home was entirely magnolia. We lived in that house for five or six years, and I think the only thing that got painted was the kitchen, in a pale pink.

Anyway, this chromatic trip down memory lane is inspired by my painting my living room. I've lived in this house for over a year, and it was about time I put my own stamp on it. To go with a lamp I was given for Christmas, I've decided to paint one wall a deep green colour, and the remainder a white. I haven't decorated in a very long time - I think not since 1998, when I painted my student flat bedroom blue - and I'm feeling rather out of practice. It's taken me about two hours to paint this one wall, and it's gone fairly well. However, I've bought rather too much green paint. One tin probably would have done the entire room, not just the wall. So I'm now looking for other things that would look better in green.

Next up is to paint all the remaining walls, currently a tired magnolia, in an "antique white" colour. Should I wait for the green to dry completely? It's a small room and it's difficult to move furniture out of the way.
