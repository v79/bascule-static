I haven't blogged as often as I had hoped. In fact, if it wasn't for the fact that comments are moderated, this blog would be mostly spam comments. I do have several draft posts in progress, the most recent of which is on science fiction in books and on TV. I haven't finished any of them, however, as I have found that I do <em>tend to go on a bit</em>Â with long and rambly posts - and often quite ranty ones as well.

It's given me a new-found respect for newspaper columnists, who have to write to many more constraints than I will ever need to on this blog. I'm also rethinking how I write - perhaps an edited stream-0f-consciousness is not the way to go, and instead I should be planning an essay beforehand. It's almost like school - less so university, where my computer science degree didn't really require much in the way of narrative writing.

I'm sure you don't want to read what I'm having for tea, or the dull minutiae of my work life. I don't to throw my tuppence into well-worn arguments like Apple vs Google, Left vs Right, America vs Europe, Amazon vs Waterstone's. I do want to share my thoughts on eBooks, independent shops, the publishing industry and writing - but only once I've got something coherent and meaningful to say.

And I don't want to write blog posts where all-but-one of the sentences starts with the letter '**I**'.
