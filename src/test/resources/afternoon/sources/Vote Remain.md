My facebook feed has been pretty much devoid of pro-Brexit voices, and for that I am grateful. Whether it's my carefully curated selection of friends, or facebook's algorithms maintaining a comforting filter bubble, I'm pleased to see that most if not all of you seem to be in the #remain camp.

The EU is a creaking organisation, and I think it rather overreached itself with the single currency and, for some, a desire for ever-greater economic and political union. But the founding principles of the EU - peace, equality for all citizens, free movement of goods and people - are as sound as they ever were.

There are 28 members of the EU, representing over 508m people, each with their own complicated histories of war and strife, each proud of their own identity. Those 28 countries have come together to be part of something greater than they can be alone, and together they have created the largest, most successful free-trade block in the world. They have done so while supporting the rights of workers, of women, of minorities, of local languages and regional foods, of holiday goers and, yes, of economic migrants and refugees.

There's stuff about the Union that I don't like, even worries me - the obtuse power of the European Commission, the rise of TTIP, the bloat of CAP - but none of this scares me as much as the unholy triumvirate of Gove, Boris and Farage. Gove wants to leave so he can dismantle the NHS and workers' rights; Boris wants to be PM (and just two years ago he was against Brexit); Farage is drunk on some distant memory of the British Empire and Little-Englander fantasies. To vote Leave would be to give succour to those voices - remember, Farage hasn't even managed to get enough people to vote for him as their MP, why should we be following him now?

I am hoping for a strong #remain vote today, and I hope that the UK can begin to heal after the nastiest, most dishonest, scary political campaign in my memory. Britain is \#strongerin, Scotland is \#strongerin, and I firmly believe that England is \#strongerin too. In 2014, David Cameron urged Scots not to use the independence referendum as a chance to "kick the Tories" - this time round, to vote leave would be to kick yourself, your friends and families, in order to further the political aims of Gove, Boris and Farage.

I'm not even going to discuss immigration - I don't think it's possible to do so in a fair, meaningful way anymore. Just be certain that \#Brexit will not stop immigration, and that immigration is not the reason why you struggled to get an NHS appointment. Blame for that lies squarely with austerity economics.

Finally, if you are considering voting leave with the hope of triggering Scottish \#indyref2 - please don't. That will just muddy the waters even further, and will make any independent Scotland's succession into the EU that more complicated.

I will be voting \#remain today, and I urge all my friends to do the same.

\#voteremain \#strongerin
